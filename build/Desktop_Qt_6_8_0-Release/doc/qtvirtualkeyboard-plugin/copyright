Comment:
 The following files are binary blobs and mostly not in the preferred form
 of modification, so we cannot ship them:
 .
  - lipi-toolkit/projects/alphanumeric/config/default/nn.mdt (see QTBUG-74719)
  - lipi-toolkit/projects/demonumerals/config/pointfloat_nn/nn.mdt
  - tcime/data/java/*.dat
  - tcime/data/qt/*.dat
  - openwnn/wnnEngine/predef_table.h
  - openwnn/wnnEngine/WnnJpnDic.c
  - pinyin/data/dict_pinyin.dat
 .
 If someone needs this functionality in Qt Virtual Keyboard, we recommend
 them to package the modules in question so we can use them as system
 libraries.
